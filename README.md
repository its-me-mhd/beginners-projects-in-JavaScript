# JavaScript Beginner Projects

Welcome to the **JavaScript Beginner Projects** repository! This repo is designed to help you get hands-on practice with JavaScript by working through small, beginner-friendly projects. Each project is organized into separate folders (e.g., `app-1`, `app-2`, etc.) and comes with its own set of instructions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

To get started, clone this repository to your local machine. Open your terminal and use the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sonagara-vashram/beginners-projects-in-JavaScript.git
```

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

### 2. Navigate to a Project Folder

Each project is stored in its own folder (e.g., `app-1`, `app-2`, etc.). Navigate to the project folder you want to work on by running:

```bash
cd beginners-projects-in-JavaScript/app-1
```

### 3. Open the Project

To view the project, you can open the `index.html` file in your preferred browser. If youâ€™re using VS Code, you can launch a local server for a smoother experience:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code.
2. Right-click on `index.html` and select **"Open with Live Server"** (you need the Live Server extension installed).
